    <h1>Adrian Blanco, Software Developer</h1>

  <section>
    <p>Hi! My name is Adrian Blanco, I'm 22 years old and currently studying my fourth year towards a masters degree in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. What do I do? I code. I started my programming journey in high school with a calculator, and since that day I knew my true calling.</p>

    <p>I have a strong theoretical background in Computer Science, so <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C/C++</strong> are my weapons of choice for solving problems. Whether it's high level or low level I love getting my hands dirty and making things work, especially if it involves learning new concepts. One of my passions is <strong>User Experience</strong> Design, which is what I'm specializing in as a track in my degree. I'm always tinkering with with <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, doing cool things with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, or just experimenting with <strong>Android</strong> development.
    </p>

    <p>Other notable (and less notable) programming skills include: AngularJS, node.js, OpenGL, OpenCL, Go, MATLAB, PHP, SQL, Haskell, Prolog, Git, Linux, LaTeX.</p>

    <h3>Other interests</h3>

    <p>I've always had a passion for music, everything from Blues to Metal. In my free time I play guitar, and hopefully one day I will also learn how to play piano. When I'm feeling energetic I like to go the gym and lift heavy things up and down.</p>
