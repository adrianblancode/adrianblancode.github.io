    <h1>Adrian Blanco, Software Developer</h1>

  <section>
    <p>Hi! My name is Adrian Blanco, I'm 22 years old and currently studying my fourth year towards a masters degree in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. What do I do? I code. I started my programming journey in high school with a calculator, and since that day I knew my true calling.</p>

    <p>I have a strong theoretical background in Computer Science, so Java and C/C++ are my weapons of choice for solving problems. Whether it's high level or low level I love getting my hands dirty and making things work, especially if it involves learning new concepts. One of my passions is User Experience Design, which is what I'm specializing in as a track in my degree. I'm always tinkering with something, whether it's coding with HTML/CSS, doing cool things with JavaScript, or just experimenting with Android development.
    </p>

    <p>Other notable (and less notable) programming skills include: AngularJS, node.js, OpenGL, OpenCL, Go, MATLAB, PHP, SQL, Haskell, Prolog, Git, Linux, LaTeX, Photoshop.</p>

    <h3>Other interests</h3>

    <p>I've always had a passion for music, everything from Blues to Metal. In my free time I play guitar, and hopefully one day I will also learn how to play piano. When I'm feeling energetic I like to go the gym and lift heavy things up and down.</p>
