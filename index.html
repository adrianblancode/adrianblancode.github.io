    <p>Hi! My name is Adrian Blanco, I'm 22 years old and currently studying my fourth year of my masters degree in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. What do I do? I code. </p>

    <h3>Other interests</h3>

    <p>I've always had a passion for music, everything from Blues to Metal. In my free time I play guitar, and hopefully one day I will also have learned how to play piano. When I'm feeling energetic I like to go weightlifting.
