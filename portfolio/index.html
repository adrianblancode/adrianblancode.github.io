  	<p>QWait is a responsive, web based queueing manager which is used for lab sessions at KTH by both students and assistants. Among my responsibilities included frontend development (AngularJS, HTML, CSS), and UX design to provide a consistent and intuitive experience for all types of users and devices.</p>

    <p>For my candidate thesis I developed a program which through genetic algorithms simulates an environment with artificial bacteria, which over time evolve to better adapt to their environments. The aim of this research was to observe co-evolution into stable ecosystems with heterogenous species.</p>
